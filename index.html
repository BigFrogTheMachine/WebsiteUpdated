<!--I improved the site by adding more photos and creating a div class row/column for
the photos to be set correctly. I readjusted what was in my internal style sheet to 
be on my external stylesheet, I added text under the images to explain what they are
as this is supposed to be a "Portfolio". Created responsive design (mainly focusing on the projects page
with how the images and Nav bar move) I learned a lot doing this, I also learned new quick keys!
I cleaned up my html docs & the CSS in a big way, overall huge improvememnt! -->
